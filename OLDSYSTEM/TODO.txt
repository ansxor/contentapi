3-29-2020:
-Come up with object system again (user, permissions, categories, etc)
-Map object system to entity system
-Figure out how "expand" fits in. If everything expanded, just make simple 
 CRUD interfaces for each object.
-NO special things: everything is an object with CRUD (including user registration)
-User registration objects. Make the client CREATE a registration.
-Fix "GetServiceOrCreateInstance" in entitysystem

4-5-2020:
-Move entity service setup to entitysystem dll (default services collection)

4-6-2020:
-Re-add or delete EntityPackage (it IS useful... but is it performant?)
-Add new testing for two queryable services EntityQueryableEfCore + Memory
-Add ability to inject different queryable to Provider for testing (want to test both in integration)
-Test other new services + functions added (which ones?)
-Package new version 2.0



content search:
-users (list?)
-categories (list)
-type (careful with %, you add one too)
-don't list content within unreadable parents (this might be complicated to implement)
