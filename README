To use:
--------

- Install dotnet core 3.1: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/3.1
- Install some IDE (I use vscode): https://code.visualstudio.com/download
- git checkout whatever

* Need a default appsettings.json, I'll get that set up somewhere
* Need an SQLITE database, IDR if that's even in the repo

If using vscode, run "code ." in the root directory.
Should be able to just start debugging at any point.
Hosting includes a swagger endpoint, something like localhost:5050/swagger/index.html. Lets you use API through web


For publishing:
---------------

 To make ssh life easier, do:
 
 ssh-keygen -t rsa
 (press enter a bunch of times)
 ssh-copy-id user@server -p sshPort
 
 Also, if using git bash for all this sh stuff, you need rsync to publish:

 (https://blog.tiger-workshop.com/add-rsync-to-git-bash-for-windows/ for original post)
 (The stupid rsync zip is stored in a new format 7zip doesn't recognize, might need https://www.tc4shell.com/en/7zip/modern7z/)
 
 Also, if on windows, you should add sqlite3 to your path.
